Ever been woken up at 3 AM by a failed encoding job? Say goodbye to those late-night troubleshooting sessions! This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server connects Anthropic's Claude directly to your encoding workflow, making video encoding issues a breeze to handle.

## ✨ What's Cool About This?

- **Smart Error Translation**: Turns cryptic "moov atom not found" messages into plain English
- **Real-time Analysis**: Connects directly to your encoding workflow and database
- **Human-Friendly Responses**: Generates clear, actionable solutions for your team
- **Auto-Email Draft**: Creates professional client communications with context
- **Always On Guard**: Monitors your encoding jobs 24/7
- **Keeps You in Control**: Suggests actions but lets you make the final call

## 🚀 Getting Started

### You'll Need

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Claude Desktop
- Your encoding workflow API credentials
- OMDB API key (optional, for movie metadata)

### Quick Setup

1. **Install the package using UV**:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv pip install encoding-devops
```

2. **Set up your environment**:
```bash
# Copy the example config
cp .env.example .env

# Add your API keys
nano .env
```

3. **Register with Claude Desktop**:
```bash
uv run mcp install ./src/encoding_devops/main.py
```

## 💡 How to Use It

```bash
# Start the MCP server
uv run mcp dev ./src/encoding_devops/main.py

# In Claude Desktop, you can now ask things like:
"What's wrong with job XYZ-123?"
"Draft an email about the failed encoding job"
"Check the encoding cluster status"
```

## 🔧 Under the Hood

The MCP server uses three main components to help you:

1. **Resources**: Email templates, error guides, and documentation
2. **Tools**: Job status checks, log analysis, and email drafting
3. **Prompts**: Instructions that help Claude understand encoding issues
